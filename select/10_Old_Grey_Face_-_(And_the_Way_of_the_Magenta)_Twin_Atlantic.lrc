[00:00.89] Old gray face
[00:02.77] Oh how the liquid seeps
[00:06.30] Through the cracks
[00:09.93] Proves that my heart still beats
[00:25.93] 
[00:13.61] Destructive pace
[00:17.21] Sure that it carries me
[00:20.88] Through my veins
[00:24.50] Into the sacred beat (beast)
[00:38.50] 
[00:29.95] I fell apart and built myself again
[00:38.15] And pieces were banged against the bend
[00:40.85] This is all you need, all you need,
[00:45.35] Listen up
[00:49.85] 
[00:46.28] Yellow hand clash with magenta feet
[00:52.62] Through the tens
[00:56.22] Fashion is out of reach
[01:07.72] 
[01:01.73] Majestic plans
[01:03.58] Throughout the summer weeks
[01:08.03] I built a car completely crush my knees
[01:27.53] 
[01:16.20] I fell apart and built myself again
[01:23.52] And pieces were banged against the bend
[01:27.13] This is all you need, all you need,
[01:30.78] Listen up
[01:35.28] 
[01:33.57] 'Cause my hands are shaking
[01:36.25] I can't eat enough
[01:40.89] My hands are shaking
[01:42.63] I can't eat listen up
[01:53.13] 
[01:47.17] I fell apart and built myself again
[02:24.46] And pieces were banged against the bend
[02:28.05] This is all you need, all you need,
[02:30.73] Listen up
[02:35.23] 
[02:34.36] 'Cause my hands are shaking
[02:37.14] I can't eat listen up
[02:41.60] My hands are shaking
[02:43.46] I can't eat listen up
