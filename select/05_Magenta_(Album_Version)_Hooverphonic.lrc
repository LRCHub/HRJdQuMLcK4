[00:48.38] Longing for winter
[00:51.07] Longing for cold
[00:53.32] Bikeride through the snow
[00:56.52] Blinded by darkness
[00:58.47] Summer flows to the cemetery slow
[01:14.97] 
[01:04.07] Pink versus black
[01:06.34] Black versus magenta
[01:08.87] This picture of you
[01:10.31] Just melts in my agenda
[01:12.86] While seasons change you know
[01:15.58] Yes, the seasons change you know
[01:19.86] With the flow
[01:26.36] 
[01:36.55] Days just shorten
[01:39.13] Days just glow
[01:41.64] This fire keeps us warm
[01:44.70] While this storm will uncover
[01:46.78] Our secret place called
[01:49.84] The cemetary dawn
[01:58.34] 
[01:52.79] Pink versus black
[01:54.53] Black versus magenta
[01:56.78] This picture of you
[01:58.41] Just melts in my agenda
[02:00.66] While seasons change you know
[02:04.25] Yes, seasons change you know
[02:08.46] (Look left)
[02:09.42] With the flow
[02:12.16] (Look down)
[02:15.83] (Look up)
[02:19.33] (Look right)
[02:23.85] (You're camouflaged by a wall of blue)
[02:36.10] (And turn the world magenta)
[02:50.10] 
[03:46.30] (Look left)
[03:50.22] (Look down)
[03:54.32] (Look up)
[03:57.93] (Look right)
[04:01.99] (You're camouflaged by a wall of blue)
[04:09.28] (A wall of blue)
[04:13.98] (And turn the world magenta)
[04:17.56] (And turn the world magenta)
[04:21.81] (And turn the world magenta)
[04:25.63] (And turn the world magenta)
[04:29.45] (And turn the world magenta)
