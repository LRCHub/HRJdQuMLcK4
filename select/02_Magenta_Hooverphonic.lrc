[00:52.11] Longing for winter
[00:53.06] Longing for cold
[00:54.85] Bikeride through the snow
[00:57.56] Blinded by darkness
[00:59.42] Summer flows to the cemetery slow
[01:15.92] 
[01:04.85] Pink versus black
[01:06.63] Black versus magenta
[01:09.32] This picture of you
[01:12.05] Just melts in my agenda
[01:13.80] While seasons change you know
[01:16.51] Yes, the season change you know
[01:21.11] With the flow
[01:27.61] 
[01:36.52] Days just shorten
[01:40.13] Days just glow
[01:42.89] This fire keeps us warm
[01:46.48] While this storm will uncover
[01:48.27] Our secret place called
[01:50.05] The cemetary dawn
[01:58.55] 
[01:53.70] Pink versus black
[01:55.53] Black versus magenta
[01:58.24] This picture of you
[01:59.16] Just melts in my agenda
[02:01.89] While seasons change you know
[02:05.48] Yes, season change you know
[02:09.90] (Look left)
[02:10.99] With the flow
[02:12.67] (Look down)
[02:16.34] (Look up)
[02:20.89] (Look right)
[02:25.39] (You're camouflaged by a wall of blue)
[02:37.13] (And turn the world magenta ...)
