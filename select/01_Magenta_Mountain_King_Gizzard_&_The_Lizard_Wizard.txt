Look past the dying trees
Beyond waterless seas
Atop the horizon, adjacent to the sun
Give my word that it's there
Magenta mountain

What do you mean
You can't see it?
Life must be a dream, a living fantasy
Disappeared in hot air
Magenta mountain

I don't believe you
Your eyes deceive you
Better check yourself in
The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream
Can't you see, you've gone insane?

I packed my bags and my swag for the road
Followed the bows of the ancient railroads
Need to rendezvous where clouds can't misconstrue
I'm certain it's real
Magenta mountain

You will say I'm crazy
I will go on my way 'cause it's what I need
I'd cross a thousand seas just to prove I'm not mad
Magenta mountain

Magenta mountain

It's you again (yeah)
I thought I saw a statue blink
And a bird with no head
Land on a golden thread, I rub my eyes
What am I saying? There's nothing there

Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
Don't wanna be left
Never not making it there

What was confusing
Is now seducing
Imagination is a powerful thing
I see a flash of purple stone closing in

Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
Don't wanna be left
Never not making it there

I am tectonic, I am megalithic
My spirit runs mauve
I am the mountain of which you dream
I see you now behind the lens, looking back at me

We fell through a dream across clouds of glue
Anamnesis crashing through

Magenta mountain

Magenta mountain

Magenta mountain

Magenta mountain

Magenta mountain
