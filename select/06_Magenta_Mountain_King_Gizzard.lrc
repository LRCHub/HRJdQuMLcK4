[00:43.56] Look past the dying trees
[00:48.57] Beyond waterless seas
[00:54.15] Atop the horizon, adjacent to the sun
[00:59.36] Give my word that it's there
[01:02.00] Magenta mountain
[01:10.00] 
[01:05.07] What do you mean
[01:10.13] You can't see it?
[01:15.10] Life must be a dream, a living fantasy
[01:20.17] Disappeared in hot air
[01:22.65] Magenta mountain
[01:30.65] 
[01:26.22] I don't believe you
[01:30.40] Your eyes deceive you
[01:35.95] Better check yourself in
[01:38.41] The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream
[01:42.57] Can't you see, you've gone insane?
[01:59.57] 
[02:01.41] I packed my bags and my swag for the road
[02:06.56] Followed the bows of the ancient railroads
[02:12.48] Need to rendezvous where clouds can't misconstrue
[02:17.09] I'm certain it's real
[02:19.47] Magenta mountain
[02:27.47] 
[02:23.30] You will say I'm crazy
[02:28.53] I will go on my way 'cause it's what I need
[02:35.11] I'd cross a thousand seas just to prove I'm not mad
[02:40.11] Magenta mountain
[02:48.11] 
[02:50.48] Magenta mountain
[02:58.48] 
[02:54.10] It's you again (yeah)
[02:58.25] I thought I saw a statue blink
[03:03.35] And a bird with no head
[03:06.55] Land on a golden thread, I rub my eyes
[03:10.75] What am I saying? There's nothing there
[03:30.25] 
[03:13.18] Magenta mountain
[03:18.22] Magenta mountain
[03:22.82] It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
[03:29.83] Don't wanna be left
[03:31.88] Never not making it there
[03:44.38] 
[03:35.63] What was confusing
[03:40.00] Is now seducing
[03:45.52] Imagination is a powerful thing
[03:50.53] I see a flash of purple stone closing in
[04:10.53] 
[03:54.78] Magenta mountain
[03:59.97] Magenta mountain
[04:04.65] It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
[04:11.59] Don't wanna be left
[04:13.43] Never not making it there
[04:25.93] 
[04:17.07] I am tectonic, I am megalithic
[04:26.76] My spirit runs mauve
[04:29.25] I am the mountain of which you dream
[04:31.93] I see you now behind the lens, looking back at me
[04:56.43] 
[04:47.35] We fell through a dream across clouds of glue
[04:53.04] Anamnesis crashing through
[05:06.04] 
[05:05.20] Magenta mountain
[05:13.20] 
[05:15.56] Magenta mountain
[05:23.56] 
[05:26.17] Magenta mountain
[05:34.17] 
[05:36.41] Magenta mountain
[05:44.41] 
[05:46.68] Magenta mountain
[05:54.68] 
[05:57.25] Magenta mountain
